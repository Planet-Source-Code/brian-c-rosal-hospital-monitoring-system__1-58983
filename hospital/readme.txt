Good day VB programmers!!!!!!!!


the program is just a simple example using DAO connection
with modules and can print the output of the form, with dynamic data
retrieval depending on the query.


Another feature of the program it has administration section and user section
you can also save all login users......hahahahaha

The program is for free....fix or edit it at your own risk...
I would like also to inform you guys that the program uses chameleon
which i downloaded and applied....its great having chameleon buttons in 
your program.....
